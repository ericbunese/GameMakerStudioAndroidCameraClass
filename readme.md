# AndroidCameraClass for Game Maker Studio

This is a simple stub extension for Game Maker Studio
with basic functionality for requesting permissions and
showing a camera intent to capture an image.

Known issues:
I Couldn't get Game Maker to compile onRequestPermissionsResult,
so I've commented that out.

Future updates:
Add gallery browsing to pick images into Game Maker.
